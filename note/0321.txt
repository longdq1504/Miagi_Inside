AngularJS

I. A better solution is to read the live data from a server. We can do this by creating a service.

+ create service 
+ in controller, use service to fetch data from server

standalone: doc lap

==================SERVICE

Why are services useful? Instead of filling the controller with code to fetch weather data from a server, it’s better to move this independent logic into a service so that it can be reused by other parts of the app.


+ Directives are a way to make standalone UI components, like <app-info>

+ Services are a way to make standalone communication logic, like forecast which fetches weather data from a server

+ Routes are a way to manage apps containing more views.

==================ROUTING

Why are routes useful? Instead of filling a single view with more code than needed, routes let us map URLs to self-contained controllers and templates. Furthermore, now that the app has URLs, users can easily bookmark and share the app’s pages.

1. app.js 
app.config  $routeProvider-> routes

2. HomeController + Photo service (app.factory) -> fetch data -> home.html
PhotoController $routeParams


photo.js

app.factory('photos', ['$http', function($http) {
  return $http.get('https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/ltp4/photos-api/photos.json')
         .success(function(data) {
           return data;
         })
         .error(function(data) {
           return data;
         });
}]);

=======================================
ng-click
ng-repeat
ng-model ng-bind {{ }}
ng-if="$odd"/"even"
ng-disabled
ng-show (= expression)
ng-hide
ng-switch ng-switch-when


+ INPUT STATE
Input fields have the following states:
$untouched The field has not been touched yet
$touched The field has been touched
$pristine The field has not been modified yet
$dirty The field has been modified
$invalid The field content is not valid
$valid The field content is valid


+ FORM STATE
Forms have the following states:
$pristine No fields have been modified yet
$dirty One or more have been modified
$invalid The form content is not valid
$valid The form content is valid
$submitted The form is submitted

+ SERVICE: $location, $http, $timeout, $interval

+ ANGULAR API
angular.lowercase()
angular.uppercase()
angular.isString()
angular.isNumber()

+ ANGULARJS INCLUDES
 ---> Include Cross Domains

+ Angular Animations
  ngAnimate
+ AngularJS Routing ()
  ngRoute
  Applications can only have one ng-view directive, and this will be the placeholder for all views provided by the route.

Because the ng-repeat directive repeats a block of HTML code for each item in an array, it can be used to create options in a dropdown list, but the ng-options directive was made especially for filling a dropdown list with options, and has at least one important advantage:

Dropdowns made with ng-options allows the selected value to be an object, while dropdowns made from ng-repeat has to be a string.
========================================

Root Scope
All applications have a $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML element that contains the ng-app directive.

The rootScope is available in the entire application.

If a variable has the same name in both the current scope and in the rootScope, the application uses the one in the current scope.
