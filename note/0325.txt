    actions: bindActionCreators(sessionActions, dispatch)
  };
};

(alias) bindActionCreators<typeof sessionActions>(actionCreators: typeof sessionActions, dispatch: Dispatch<any>): typeof sessionActions (+3 overloads)
import bindActionCreators
Turns an object whose values are action creators, into an object with the same keys, but with every function wrapped into a dispatch call so they may be invoked directly. This is just a convenience method, as you can call store.dispatch(MyActionCreators.doSomething()) yourself just fine.

For convenience, you can also pass a single function as the first argument, and get a function in return.

@param actionCreator
An object whose values are action creator functions. One handy way to obtain it is to use ES6 import * as syntax. You may also pass a single function.

@param dispatch — The dispatch function available on your Redux store.

@returns
The object mimicking the original object, but with every action creator wrapped into the dispatch call. If you passed a function as actionCreator, the return value will also be a single function.
